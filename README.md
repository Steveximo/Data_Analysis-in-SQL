# ABOUT THE PROJECT

 This project/repository analyzed some of the reported causes of deaths globally for the periods
 according to different countries and the continents.
 The data set is from "KAGGLE" an online data source and can be accessed at
 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/madhurpant/world-deaths-and-causes-1990-2019

 Approximately 65 million people(7.6%) die every year from common known diseases such as malaria, 
 HIV/AIDS,Cardiovascular diseases e.t.c and also from rare causes such as poisonings,terrorism,
 road-injuries e.tc and these vary country to country and continent to continent.
 
 The main goal of the project was to understand and draw insights about these deaths due to these causes
 and how they vary between countries and continents.
  
 All the analysis  was done using SQL server while Data visualization was done using Power BI.
 However, due to the limitation of power service sharing, only a non-interactive dashboard was created.
